# Advanced-Routing-Algorithm-
The proposed algorithm can effectively find robust cluster leader considering energy and connectivity parameters. The low energy states in the cluster are solved by applying probabilistic models for finding a node with available energy. The algorithm can also withstand the extra low energy condition in the cluster but that comes at the cost of latency in the network. However, latency can be tolerated for having an efficient network structure. Thus, the algorithm is best suitable for partially connected wireless sensor networks where not every node can hear each other.
